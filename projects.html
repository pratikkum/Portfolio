										<span class="label"><b>Broadband penetration in Ireland using Postgres and Postgis</b> </span></li> </br></a>
										<p>
												The main objective of this project is to examine the penetration of domestic broadband networking across counties and electoral divisions in Ireland and create a map representation for the same. 
										</p>
										<p>
												Dublin county has the highest penetration, but on the other hand remaining counties (except one’s sharing boundary with Dublin like Kildare, Wicklow and Meath) like Kerry, Mayo, Donegal are still devoid from having full scale Broadband availability for its people.
												Over 67 % of counties in Ireland have less than 69 % of Broadband penetration, especially lower in rural areas. Looking further at atomic levels of Electoral Divisions, we see that spatial distribution of Broadband penetrations is widely scattered across the country and though Ireland is gently moving towards digitization, there is an urgent need for rapid development in rural areas.

												<p>
														Analysis of work pattern across Ireland for insights on the most favorable counites for different industries. 
														Though there are numerous industries, I have categorized them into four groups as below and analyzed the 
														leading counites in each sector: -</br>
														Type 1: - Agriculture and Forestry.
														Type 2: - Building, Industrial and Manufacturing.
														Type 3: - Commerce, Trade and Transport.
														Type 4: - Other like Administration, Professional services, Hospitality etc.
												</p>
												<p>
														Results of the analysis from the spatial data shows that Dublin and Cork have dominant industries and this is precisely due to the larger population, suitable geographical location and better land area segmentation. About 35% of Ireland’s population is concentrated in these areas as they are developed and cater most software companies, businesses and have some of the best educational institutes.

									<li id =p3><a href="https://github.com/pratikkum/Postgraduate-Student-Survey-Analysis">
												<span class="label"><b>Student workload satisfaction modeling and prediction using SAS and tableau</b></span></li> </br></a>	
												<p>
														Aim was to conduct a survey with Maynooth University postgraduates (or some subset of them) as the population and analyse and interpret workload satisfaction among students using SAS.
												</p>
												<p>
														I found that, surprisingly, there was no relationship between lecture attendance and the level of student satisfaction with course workload. Instead, a combination of Age, Level, Course, Gender and Job were determined to be the most powerful predictors.
												</p>
									<li id =p4><a href="https://github.com/pratikkum/Property-Price-Estimation-in-Greater-LONDON-">
												<span class="label"><b>Housing price estimation in the UK using Python</b></span></li></br></a>	
												<p>
														The purpose of the project is to analyse and find the most decisive determinants of housing prices in Greater London area.
														Using exploratory analyses and different Machine Learning techniques in R, we need to establish the relationships between several predictors variables and a response variable (Price) in this project.  
												</p>
												<p>
														The most important predictor is FlorArea, and it is directly proportional to the price of a property despite of location.
														Other significant predictors from the Random Forest model were Type of house, Bathroom and Bedrooms. There was a contrasting feature of this model when compared to linear regression that Tenfree, CenHeat and Garage were predicted to be insignificant, which were considered significant initially. There is significant spatial variation in the given dataset, i.e. the houses near the centre of London city are priced more compared to ones located near the exterior boundaries of the map. City of London is the most expensive area due its locality with more than 75 % of houses above 1 Million GBP.

									<li id =p5><a href="https://github.com/pratikkum/Satisfaction-analysis-and-prediction-of-Taught-Masters-Students-in-Ireland">
													<span class="label"><b>Satisfaction analysis and prediction of Taught Masters Students’ in Ireland using R</b></span></li> </br></a>
													<p>
															This project was based on implementing various machine learning techniques and comparing them to find the best set of predictors that would then be validated to find the true relationship with the satisfaction among students, i.e. if it has a positive or negative association and how much they impact satisfaction perception. 
													</p>
													<p>
															The results revealed that Teaching Quality, Organization of timetable and studies, the Teaching staff's attitude towards students, and Study amenities were the most critical reasons that students consider while rating their satisfaction with college. Satisfaction with accommodation is determined with gender, average monthly expenditure, financial difficulty indicator, felt cheerful indicator and rent paid indicator. Financial difficulty indicator and felt cheerful indicator majorly influence financial and well-being satisfaction.
